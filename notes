Night: Werewolves vote who to kill, Seer selects person to reveal
Day: Announce Deaths (if any) -> Voting Phase

Day/Night - Votes for both day and night are done during the "day". While villagers
vote on who to hang, the werewolves/seer will get a second panel to vote 
on who to choose*.

If WW don't make a consensus before a vote is made, a random pick out of 
their current choices will be made.
